#Description	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample	Any technique used to validate PDX against their original patient tumour, including fingerprinting, histology, immunohistochemistry - if several technique were used to validate one model, please list all  techniques/descriptions/passage used. Add rows as necessary.	Short description of what was compared and what was the result: (e.g. high, good, moderate concordance between xenograft, 'model validated against histological features of same diagnosis' or 'not determined') - It needs to be clear if the model is validated or not.	Provide a list of all passages where validation was performed. Passage 0 correspond to first engraftment (if this is not the case please define how passages are numbered).	Validation host mouse strain, following mouse strain nomenclature from MGI JAX.
