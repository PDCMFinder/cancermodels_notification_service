#Description	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample	Host mouse strain name (e.g. NOD-SCID, NSG, etc)	The full nomenclature form of the host mouse strain name. 	Organ or anatomical site used for the PDX tumour engraftment (e.g. mammary fat pad, Right flank)	PDX Engraftment Type: Orthotopic if the tumour was engrafted at a corresponding anatomical  site (e.g. patient tumour of primary site breast was grafted in mouse mamary fat pad). If grafted subcuteanously use hererotopic	Description of the type of  material grafted into the mouse. (e.g. tissue fragments, cell suspension)	PDX Engraftment material state (e.g. fresh or frozen). If other please describe	Passage number -  When different host strains, or PDX Engraftment Site or PDX Engraftment Type or PDX Engraftment Materia were used during the PDX line generation,  please add passage - add rows per model as needed.  We assume that passage 0 correspond to first engraftment - if not the case please indicate what passage 0 correspond to. passage number- add rows if columns D,E,F, G changes - if no change and always same D,E,F,G add 'all' as passage value to specify the conditions are the same in all passages.	If model has been part of a published study include pubmed IDs separated by commas.
