#Description	Unique identify to platform metadata between sheets. can simply be molecular_charaterisation_type + a numerical identifier. No identifyer is needed if unique	"Please use one of: ""cytogenetics"" (FISH IHC), ""microsatellite"" (microsatellite stability/instability), ""copy number alteration"" (CGH, CNA from NGS), ""mutation"" (mutation data dervied from NGS or PCR), ""expression"" (for RNA expression generated from NGS , microarray or qPCR), if not on the list please contact PDX Finder team , we will create a term."	The name of the platform technology used to produce the molecular characterisation,  This could be the sequencer or the name of the micorarrary	The library strategy species the sequencing techniuqe intended fo this library. Examples: WGS,WGA,WXS, RNA-Seq, Amplicon, Targeted-capture	The library selection specifies whether any method was used to select for or against, enrich, or screen the material being sequenced. (PCR, cDNA, Hybrid Selection, PolyA, RANDOM)	Include any information suitable to characterise the platform used. Include the link to a commercial gene panel or a gene list if a custom panel was used	Genome assembly that the associated variant data is mapped to.
