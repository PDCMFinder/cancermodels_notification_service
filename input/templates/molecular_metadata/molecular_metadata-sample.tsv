#Description	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample. This needs to be unique to represent an aggregated PDX line : combination between a mouse strain and a unique grafted tumour sample	Identifier of the sample from any patient tissue or PDX derived sample from which OMIC data was generated	The orgin of the sample - xenograft (extracted from PDX model) or patient (directly extracted from the patient)	Indicate the passage number of the sample where the PDX sample was harvested (where passage 0 corresponds to first engraftment). Not applicable if the sample_origin is patient, leave blank in this case.	Host mouse strain name (e.g. NOD-SCID, NSG, etc)- When different mouse strain was used during the PDX line generation, please add a new row with correposding passage numbers.For first engraftment (passage 0: We need strain,engraftment site, type,material, status. We also require this information for any passage where information is shared (OMIC or drug) - We assume that passage 0 correspond to first engraftment - if not the case please indicate what passage 0 correspond to.	The full nomenclature form of the host mouse strain name. Use Not Specified if unknown.	The anatomical site from which the xenograft sample was extracted from after engraftment.Not applicable if the sample_origin is patient, leave blank in this case.	Unique identify to platform metadata between sheets. can simply be molecular_charaterisation_type + a numerical identifier. No identifyer is needed if unique	Unique identify to platform metadata between sheets. can simply be molecular_charaterisation_type + a numerical identifier. No identifyer is needed if unique
